# Java Backend Interview Questions & Answers

This document provides a complete set of **Java Backend Interview Questions & Answers** structured from beginner to advanced, with practical system design concepts.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Level (Core Java)

### 1. What are the main features of Java?
**Answer (Interview style):**  
Java is platform-independent because of the JVM, itâ€™s object-oriented, secure, and robust. It also supports multithreading, automatic garbage collection, and has a rich standard library. These features make Java widely used in backend development.

### 2. Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
**Answer:**  
- JDK is the Java Development Kit, it provides tools for developing and compiling Java programs.  
- JRE is the Java Runtime Environment, which is needed to run Java applications.  
- JVM is the Java Virtual Machine, it executes the bytecode.  

So, JDK = JRE + Development tools, and JRE = JVM + libraries.

### 3. What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()`?
**Answer:**  
`==` compares references, whether two objects point to the same memory location.  
`.equals()` is used to compare the actual content.  
For example, two `String` objects with the same value may not be `==`, but `.equals()` will return true.

---

### 4. What is a constructor in Java?
**Answer:**  
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and doesnâ€™t have a return type. Itâ€™s automatically called when an object is created.

---

### 5. Difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
**Answer:**  
Checked exceptions are checked at compile time, like `IOException`.  
Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime, like `NullPointerException`.  
In backend development, we usually handle checked exceptions explicitly with try-catch or throws.

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level (OOP, Collections, Multithreading)

### 6. Can you explain the four pillars of OOP?
**Answer:**  
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Binding data and methods together, usually through classes.  
- **Abstraction** â†’ Exposing only necessary details, like using interfaces and abstract classes.  
- **Inheritance** â†’ Reusing code by deriving classes from parent classes.  
- **Polymorphism** â†’ Same method behaving differently, like method overloading and overriding.

### 7. What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
**Answer:**  
- `ArrayList` is backed by an array, so accessing elements is faster (O(1)), but inserting in the middle is slower.  
- `LinkedList` is backed by nodes, so insertions and deletions are faster (O(1)) if you already have the reference, but access is slower (O(n)).  

---

### 8. What is the difference between `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`?
**Answer:**  
`HashMap` is not thread-safe, multiple threads can cause data inconsistency.  
`ConcurrentHashMap` is thread-safe, it uses segment-level locking or buckets to allow concurrent reads and controlled writes, making it better for multi-threaded backend applications.

---

### 9. What is the difference between `synchronized` and `volatile`?
**Answer:**  
- `synchronized` is used to lock a block or method so that only one thread can access it at a time.  
- `volatile` ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads, but doesnâ€™t guarantee atomicity.  

So, `synchronized` is for both visibility and atomicity, `volatile` is only for visibility.

---

### 10. How does Java handle memory management?
**Answer:**  
Java uses automatic garbage collection. Objects are stored in heap memory, and unused objects are collected by the garbage collector. The JVM uses different generations (young, old, permanent/metaspace) to optimize collection.

---

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level (Spring, Hibernate, Concurrency, Performance)

### 11. What is Dependency Injection in Spring?
**Answer:**  
Dependency Injection is a design pattern where objects donâ€™t create their dependencies themselves. Instead, they are injected by the Spring container. This makes code loosely coupled and easier to test.

---

### 12. What is the difference between Spring Boot and Spring MVC?
**Answer:**  
Spring MVC provides a framework for building web applications, but you have to configure a lot manually.  
Spring Boot makes development faster by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers (like Tomcat), and production-ready features with minimal setup.

---

### 13. What is the difference between Hibernate and JDBC?
**Answer:**  
- JDBC is a low-level API for interacting with databases using SQL queries.  
- Hibernate is an ORM framework that maps Java objects to database tables, so we work with objects instead of SQL directly.  
Hibernate handles caching, lazy loading, and transactions better than raw JDBC.

---

### 14. How do you handle transactions in Spring?
**Answer:**  
We use the `@Transactional` annotation to manage transactions declaratively. Spring takes care of starting, committing, or rolling back transactions automatically. This avoids boilerplate transaction code and makes business logic cleaner.

---

### 15. Explain microservices in backend development.
**Answer:**  
Microservices is an architecture where applications are broken down into small, independent services that communicate through APIs (usually REST or gRPC). Each service can be deployed, scaled, and maintained independently.  
For example, in an e-commerce app, we may have separate services for inventory, payments, and orders.

---

## ðŸŸ£ System Design & Practical Backend

### 16. How would you design a scalable backend for a high-traffic application?
**Answer:**  
I would use a microservices architecture with load balancers in front. Each service would use caching (like Redis), a database with read replicas, and messaging queues (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) for asynchronous tasks.  
Iâ€™d also add monitoring tools like Prometheus + Grafana and implement CI/CD for smooth deployments.

### 17. Whatâ€™s the difference between REST and GraphQL?
**Answer:**  
REST exposes fixed endpoints with fixed responses, while GraphQL allows clients to query exactly the data they need.  
GraphQL reduces over-fetching but is more complex to implement. REST is simpler and widely used in backend APIs.

---

### 18. How do you handle security in Java backend applications?
**Answer:**  
I follow best practices like:  
- Using Spring Security for authentication and authorization.  
- Storing passwords with hashing algorithms like bcrypt.  
- Securing APIs with JWT or OAuth2.  
- Validating inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS.  
- Using HTTPS and secure headers.

---

### 19. Explain caching strategies in backend systems.
**Answer:**  
We can use:  
- **In-memory caching** with tools like Redis or Ehcache.  
- **Write-through** cache (write goes to cache + DB).  
- **Write-behind** cache (write goes to cache, async update DB).  
- **Read-through** cache (fetches from DB if not in cache).  

Caching improves performance and reduces DB load.

---

### 20. What are some performance tuning techniques in Java?
**Answer:**  
- Use connection pooling with databases.  
- Use caching to reduce redundant calls.  
- Optimize garbage collection with proper JVM tuning.  
- Minimize synchronization in multithreaded apps.  
- Profile and monitor using tools like JVisualVM or JProfiler.
